MecanimEffects
==============

Bind visual effects to Mecanim (Unity 3D animation system) states in the editor.

## What is effect

We define effect here as a GameObject prefab. It can contain animated textures, particle emitters, audio sources, anything you want. Follow next few steps to create a sample effect.

1. Create an empty GameObject with Game Object > Create empty menu command.
2. In the Inspector window click Add Component button and select Effects > Particle system.
3. Drag that game object from Hierarchy to Project window to create a new prefab.
4. That's it!

## Using effects with Unity Editor

To try out mecanim effects you'll need a scene with any object animated with mecanim. Open that scene in Unity Editor and prepare the sample effect like the one defined before.

1. In scene view select any object animated with Mecanim. It must have Animator component attached and a state machine with two or more states.
2. In the Inspector window click Add Component button and select EffectsController.
3. In the EffectsController inspector select animator, add one binding to the Bindings list, and expand it.
4. In the Binding inspector set State Name property to any of existing states by typing "<Layer Name>.<State Name>" without quotes.
5. Expand the Effects property and add 1 (one) effect and expand it.
6. In the Effect inspector set the Prefab property to previously created sample effect prefab.
7. Done!

Now you can run the scene and see effect appears when object goes into selected state and disappears when state is changing.

## Additional editor features

* By default effects appears as transform children of the object EffectsController is attached to. You can change this behavior by setting the Subject property in the Effect inspector.
* You can use Animator component from any GameObject in the scene.
* Use Reset On Replay flag in the Effect inspector to send Reset message to effect every time it is played.
* 

## Scripting effects

Mecanim Effects utilizes [Unity 3D messaging system](http://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/ScriptReference/Component.SendMessage.html) to introduce the custom scripting feature. Also state information and timer values are precalculated every frame and can be used in your scripts.

### Messages

EffectsController can send three types of messages to the game object it is attached to.

* **Enter Message** is sent in Update cycle in the first frame of the selected animator state;
* **Update Message** is sent in Update cycle every frame the selected animator state remains active;
* **Timer Message** is sent in Update cycle when timer reaches the timer treshold and only if timer treshold is more than zero;
* **Exit Message** is sent in Update cycle in the frame following the last frame of the selected animator state.

Messages are sent only if name is explicitly specified in the Inspector window. When appopriate field is blank no message is sent to the object. Messages are sent using [SendMessageOptions.RequireReceiver](http://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/ScriptReference/SendMessageOptions.RequireReceiver.html) option value, so there will be a warning about unhandled messages.

At the moment an update message is sent along with enter message in the same update cycle. However this behavior is under question and may be changed in the future.

Example of message handler in C#:

````c#
void OnBaseLayerMoveEnter(EffectUpdateEventArgs e) {
   // your logic here
}
````

### Timers and states

Current state and transition information is provided with EffectUpdateEventArgs class instace.  Here is the EffectUpdateEventArgs class definition: 

````c#
public class EffectUpdateEventArgs : System.EventArgs {
  public EffectsController controller;
  public int layerIndex;
}
````

Using controller.layerState array along with layerIndex value you can query and manipulate the handled animator's state or transition information. EffectUpdateEventArgs instance is sent along with every message. 

Timings are essential for building game effects and animations. MecanimEffects provides you with Timer Message and the animator state timer values are calculated each Update call. You can use them within your messsage handlers. MecanimEffects provides following values:

1. State seconds - state time in seconds from the beginning of current iteration.
2. State seconds total - state time in seconds from the beginning of the first iteration.
3. Loop count - state iteration count.

Example of getting a value:

````c#
void OnMyStateUpdate(EffectUpdateEventArgs e) {
   var stateSeconds = e.controller.layerState[e.layerIndex].stateSeconds;
}
````

You are not expected to store the reference to the instance of EffectUpdateEventArgs between calls or change its fields values. You are not expected to use layerState array outside of EffectController's message hadlers. This is because Unity 3D does not determine the order of calling Update on GameObject and therefore you can accidentaly get data from previous frame or uninitialized references in the first frame.

## Roadmap

* Custom inspector UI - default inspector looks creepy and unintuintive, a new cool Inspector UI is coming soon!
* Cross-state effects caching - states with same effect bound can share cachedInstance.
* Continious effects - effects do not disappear in transition if the next state have similar effect attached. This is possible only with cross-state caching.
